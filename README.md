# Solar Power Panel Performance Prediction

The Solar Power Panel Performance Prediction system is a Python-based application that uses **linear regression** to estimate the daily energy output of solar panels based on environmental conditions. This project is designed to assist in optimizing solar energy production by providing accurate predictions based on key variables like temperature,visability,sky cover, and humidity and more variables.

## How It Works
The system leverages the following components:
ight hours
- **Environmental Data**: The system utilizes data on factors such as sunlight, temperature, and humidity to predict solar power output.

- **Data Preprocessing**: The raw data is cleaned and processed to ensure high-quality predictions by removing missing or inconsistent entries.

- **Linear Regression**: By applying a linear regression model, the system identifies relationships between environmental factors and solar panel performance, allowing for accurate predictions of energy output.

- **Model Evaluation**: The model is evaluated using performance metrics such as **RÂ² score** to ensure prediction accuracy.

## Dependencies
Before running the Solar Power Panel Performance Prediction system, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Usage
1. Make sure the required dependencies are installed on your system.
2. Run the main Python script to initiate the model training and prediction process.
3. The system will predict the daily energy output of solar panels based on provided environmental data.
4. Visualizations and performance metrics will be displayed for better analysis of the model's predictions.

## Code Structure
- **main.py**: The main Python script that powers the prediction system.
- **solar_data.csv**: A dataset containing historical data on solar panel output and environmental factors.
- **visualizations/**: A folder containing plots and graphs visualizing the predictions and key environmental factors.
